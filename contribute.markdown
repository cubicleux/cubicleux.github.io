Cubicle UX is a collection of inspiration for enterprise user experiences. If you find something you think is worthy to add to our collection, we'd love to see it!

1) Find It
===

A few questions to ask yourself about what you're looking at sharing:

- **Is it enterprise?** Is the purpose of this product to meet business objectives? Is the intended customers a corporation or your mom?
- **Is it inspiring?** Are the patterns depicted ones worth imitating or using as a launching point?
- **Is it a pattern?** We organize screenshots on pattern categories. What patterns are being used and what categories would you file this under?
- **Is it confidential?** Cubicle UX is a public resource. Please don't share stuff that will get you or us into trouble. Check out some of our advice around anonymizing data below.

Also, at this point we are only collecting **web app UI**, so no mobile shots. This may change in the future, but at this point, there are a glut of mobile pattern librarys out there ([Mobile Patterns](http://www.mobile-patterns.com/), [Pttrns](http://pttrns.com/), [Inspired UI](http://inspired-ui.com/), [Appreciate UI](http://www.appreciateui.com/), [A UX](http://androidux.com/)), so we're focusing on the big screens.


2) Anonymize It
===

Enterprise products often contain sensitive information that shouldn't be shared publicly. Even company names, emails or profile photos should be avoided.

**Substitue Dummy Data**

If you are capturing an HTML app, it is relatively easy to swap out text and images before capturing it. Right click on any element and select "Inspect Element." This brings up the source of the page which you can double click and edit.

![Inspect Element]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/contribute/1-inspect-element.png)

Need some help thinking up dummy data? Here are some great resources:
- [Lorem Ipsum Generator](https://lipsum.pro/)
- [UI Faces Profile Pictures](http://uifaces.com/)
- [UI Names](http://uinames.com/)
- [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

**Blur It Out**
For more data heavy screenshots, you can use Photoshop or other graphic apps to blur out text or images. The Mosaic Filter (Filter > Pixelate > Mosaic) in Photoshop is effective obscuring details.

![Mosaic Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/contribute/3-mosaic-settings.png)


3) Capture It
===

Primary screenshots should have a starting resolution of **1920×900**, with the height relative to the page. Each post can have supporting images of any size for alternate states, menus, and responsive layouts.

To get full size screenshots, we recommend using the following method.

Install [Fireshot Plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fireshot/) in [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org). Using Firefox's Responsive Design Mode, you can set the the resolution to 1920×900. Using Fireshot's "Capture Entire Page and Save" you can capture the entire length of the page at that resolution.

![Firefox Responsive Tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/contribute/6-responsive-tool.png)
![Fireshot Capture Entire Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/contribute/7-fireshot.png)
