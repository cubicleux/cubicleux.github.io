## Contributing
This site is resource for the Enterprise UX community by the Enterprise UX community. As such it is Open Source + [Open Design] (http://designopen.org/). 

### How can I help?
*Design* - Head over to the [issue discussion](https://github.com/cubicleux/cubicleux.github.io/issues/) to contribute to the design, branding, and other general conversations.

*Development* - We are still working on building the site, building from a Jekyll framework to start. Feel free to pitch in where you like, using the designs from the discussion as a source. 

*Submit Inspiration* - To submit inspiration you can:
- Fork this repo & submit a pull request with your additions ([Guide on how to contribute to Jekyll Sites] (http://designopen.org/articles/how-to-contribute/)).
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/cubicleux/cubicleux.github.io/issues/new) with your suggested link or images.

To keep images consistent as possible, please use 1024x768 resolution when creating screenshots. [Paparazzi](https://derailer.org/paparazzi/) (Mac only) is a great tool for capturing full-page screenshots.
